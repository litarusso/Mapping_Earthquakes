# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of the Analysis
This project aims to do interactive maps about earthquakes in the world for the last seven days. To do so, I used the Leaflet.js library, Javascript, and HTML to retrieve earthquake information from a GeoJSON file.

### My working steps are below:
- The tectonic plate data is added as a second layer group
- The tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object
- The d3.json() callback is working and does the following
 - The tectonic plate data is passed to the geoJSON() layer
 - The geoJSON() layer adds colour and width to the tectonic plate lines
 - The tectonic layer group variable is added to the map
- The major earthquake data is added as a third-layer group 
- The major earthquake data is added to the overlay object
- The d3.json() callback is working and does the following:
    - Sets the colour and diameter of each earthquake.
    - The major earthquake data is passed to the geoJSON() layer.
    - The geoJSON() layer creates a circle for each major earthquake and adds a popup for each circle to display the magnitude and location of the     earthquake
- The major earthquake layer group variable is added to the map
- All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the map when the page loads, and the datasets can be toggled on or off

## Summary
In the Maps below, you can see the interactive projects with three base maps and three options.
